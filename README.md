# portalRTC

A videoconferencing alternative inspired by the game Portal

This is an entry into the meteor hackathon competition.

The idea is simple.  

* You have a list of avatars you can select from.
* Select one, it opens a portal, ala the game, with all the same coolness, to that device.
* The only other features we will have are invitation and signup.

We are playing with PhoneRTC and some other meteor RTC stuff to get things done.
