# portalRTC

A videoconferencing alternative inspired by the game Portal

This is an entry into the meteor hackathon competition.

The idea is simple.  

* You have a list of avatars you can select from.
* Select one, it opens a portal, ala the game, with all the same coolness, to that device.
* The only other features we will have are invitation and signup.

We are playing with webrtc-meteor, PhoneRTC and some other meteor RTC stuff to get things done.

All of the code we have written is copyright by our team (rich and carol), and licensed under the GPLV3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), which is reputably compatible with the Apache license (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Although we may swap out for phoneRTC to get iOS compatibility, currently, this app makes use of the excellent webrtc-meteor project, which is Apache licensed:

[webrtc-meteor](https://github.com/foxdog-studios/meteor-webrtc)

All of the code for that project was written by eldog and his copyright must be applied, and the Apache software license is specified for that code.

If we have done something horribly wrong with this license or if this application makes you unhappy, we apologize in advance and will probably fix it if that involves an interesting hack.
